  <h1>Making ice cream can be a fun process! Here's a basic recipe for classic vanilla ice cream:</h1>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

<li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
<li>1 cup whole milk</li>
<li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<li><b>Combine cream, milk, and sugar:</b> In a medium saucepan, whisk together the heavy cream, whole milk, and granulated sugar. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is hot but not boiling.</li>
<li><b>Chill the mixture:</b> Remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool to room temperature. Cover the mixture and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
<li><b>Churn the ice cream:</b> Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
<li><b>Add vanilla extract:</b> Once the ice cream is almost fully churned, add the vanilla extract and continue to churn until fully incorporated.</li>
<li><b>Freeze the ice cream:</b> Transfer the churned ice cream to an airtight container and place it in the freezer to harden for at least 2 hours.</li>

<h3>No Ice Cream Maker? No Problem!</h3>

If you don't have an ice cream maker, you can also freeze the mixture in a shallow metal pan or a 9x13 inch baking dish. Stir the mixture every 30 minutes until it's the desired consistency. This can take about 2-3 hours.

<h2>Tips:</h2>

<li>Use high-quality ingredients for the best flavor.</li>
<li>Experiment with different flavorings like cocoa powder, nuts, or fruit purees.</li>
<li>If you're using mix-ins like chocolate chips or nuts, fold them into the ice cream once it's almost fully churned.</li>

<h2>Variations:</h2>

<li><b>Chocolate ice cream:</b> Add cocoa powder or melted chocolate to the mixture.</li>
<li><b>Strawberry ice cream:</b> Add strawberry puree or jam to the mixture.</li>
<li><b>Mint chip ice cream:</b> Add peppermint extract and chocolate chips to the mixture.</li>

<h3>Enjoy your delicious Ice cream</h3>
